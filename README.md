# 3 SIDED CUBE Web Dev

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


## Opening the project locally

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.



## Challenges?
- Using some of the newer Next.js features required deep dive into their docs.
- Properly syncing local storage with the progress bar UI took a while. Got a custom hook from AI to fix it

## Extra technologies?
- classNames.js: for generating dynamic classNames for components

## Extra features?
- Login, storing and retrieving the auth token (JWT) in cookies storage

## Things to implement in extra time?
- Image optimization (exported assets are a bit large)
- Radio Group component for mobile
- Make code DRYer than it currently is
- More animations
